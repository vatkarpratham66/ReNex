# ReNex
Our project aims to solve the problem of surplus resources going to waste by creating a platform that connects people, organizations, and businesses who have excess items (such as food, clothes, books, or other resources) with those who need them. This helps in reducing waste, promoting sustainability, and supporting communities.
